###  Who needs A-parametrics Statistics?

- You can't rely on small sample size for real life decisions. 


- It's seems anachronistic.

- Reading Material: [A-parametric Statistics by Alona Raviv]("http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~alona/nonparametric__Alona_Raviv.pdf")

]

.panel[.panel-name[Problem 🤔]

- The "World" wants to know about the possible breakthroughts of covid-19 Variants

- Evidence from RCT, no evidence from retrospectivve Data

- Small data set of covid-19 samples from Adi Stern Lab

]

.panel[.panel-name[Solution and Result 💡]

- Applying a-parametric method 

- No rejects from the reviewers!

- The article was published in Nature Medicine

- A HUGE (and scary!) Impact

### : 
### A-parametrics Statistics might be extremly useful
- Sometimes, small-sample size is all you've got, so you better use it.
- No need for unrealistic assumptions, which is generally good.
