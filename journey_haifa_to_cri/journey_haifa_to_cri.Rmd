# Clalit Innovation
### My workplace 💼

---

## Clalit Innovation

#### Striving for excellent healthcare by promoting innovation within Clalit and beyond 

???

- Clalit Innovation implements innovation in Clalit.

--

## Our Data

#### Clalit’s database encompasses 20 years of medical history on all ensured patients

???

- Half of the country

--

## Data Science Team

#### We are using the huge database for innovative research, predictive and preventative medicine through data and helping with internal challenges.

???

- research - articles; predictive - c-pi; internal challenges - covid19 lists.

# Then & Now: Covid-19 Research 😷

.panelset.sideways[
.panel[.panel-name[Then 🎓]
###  Who needs Nonparametric Statistics?

- You can't rely on small sample size for real life decisions. 


- It's seems anachronistic.

- Reading Material: [Nonparametric Statistics by Alona Raviv]("http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~alona/nonparametric__Alona_Raviv.pdf")

]

.panel[.panel-name[Problem 🤔]
###  Should we be concerned about Covid-19 Variants?

- The "World" wants to know about the possible breakthroughs.

- Evidence from labs experiments, no evidence from retrospective Data

- Small data set of samples.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Solution and Result 💡]
###  Using McNemar exact test

- Significant differences between the proportion of the variants.

- No rejects from the reviewers!

- The article was published in [Nature Medicine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01413-7) and made an impact.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Now 👴]
### Nonparametric Statistics might be extremly useful

- Sometimes small-sample size is all you've got, so you better use it.

- No need for unrealistic assumptions, which is generally a good thing.

# Then & Now: Predictive Models 🔮

.panelset.sideways[
.panel[.panel-name[Then 🎓]
###  Who needs Statistics?

- We've got Machine Learning, Statistics is old. 

- Students from the Computer Science department make a lot more money.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Problem 🤔]
###  Can we help clinicians by making predictions?

- We can predict well future illness.

- Our purpose is to prevent it by making intervention list for patients at risk.

- Clinicians want to know what stands behind these predictions.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Solution and Result 💡]
###  Interpretable models

- Regressions with coefficients that are in concordance with the clinic intuition.

- Comparing performance and results to well-known baseline models.

- Clinical Sanity Checks (Do we have young patient with high predictions?)

]

.panel[.panel-name[Now 👴]
### Statistics might be extremly useful

- Statistics develops all the time, and it doesn't go anywhere. 

- Students from the Computer Science department make a lot more money because they know *how to code*. 

- It's relatively easy for a statistician to learn how to code.

- It's extremely difficult for a computer scientist to learn how to be a statistician.

# Then & Now: Performance Metrics ✔️❌

### I don't see how ROC is usefull

```{r fig.align='left', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
create_roc_curve(
  probs = list(example_dat$estimated_probabilities),
  real = list(example_dat$outcome), 
  interactive = FALSE
) + 
  ggplot2::coord_fixed()
```


]

.panel[.panel-name[Problem 🤔]
###  I need to compare different models

```{r fig.align = 'left'}
create_roc_curve(
  probs = list(
    "First Model" = example_dat$estimated_probabilities,
    "Second Model" = example_dat$bad_model
  ),
  reals = list(example_dat$outcome),
  interactive = FALSE
) + 
  ggplot2::coord_fixed()
```

###  [rtichoke](https://uriahf.github.io/rtichoke/) interactive roc curve

```{r }


create_roc_curve(
  probs = list(
    "First Model" = example_dat$estimated_probabilities,
    "Second Model" = example_dat$bad_model

  reals = list(example_dat$outcome),
  interactive = TRUE
