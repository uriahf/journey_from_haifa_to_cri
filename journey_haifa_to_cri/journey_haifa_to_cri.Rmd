# Than & Now: Covid-19 Research 😷

.panel[.panel-name[Than 🎓]
###  Who needs A-parametrics Statistics?

- You can't rely on small sample size for real life decisions. 


- It's seems anachronistic.

- Reading Material: [A-parametric Statistics by Alona Raviv]("http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~alona/nonparametric__Alona_Raviv.pdf")

]

.panel[.panel-name[Problem 🤔]
###  Should we be concerned about Covid-19 Variants?

- The "World" wants to know about the possible breakthroughs.

- Evidence from labs experiments, no evidence from retrospective Data

- Small data set of samples.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Solution and Result 💡]
###  Using McNemar exact test

- Significant differences between the proportion of the variants.

- No rejects from the reviewers!

- The article was published in [Nature Medicine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01413-7) and made an impact.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Now 👴]
### A-parametrics Statistics might be extremly useful

- Sometimes small-sample size is all you've got, so you better use it.

- No need for unrealistic assumptions, which is generally a good thing.

# Than & Now: Predictive Models 🔮

.panelset.sideways[
.panel[.panel-name[Than 🎓]
###  Who needs Statistics?

- We've got Machine Learning, statistics is old. 

- Students from the Computer Science department make a lot more money.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Problem 🤔]
###  Can we help clinicians by making predictions?

- We can predict well future illness.

- Our purpose is to prevent it by making intervention list for patients at risk.

- Clinicians want to know what stands behind these predictions.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Solution and Result 💡]
###  Interpretable models

- Regressions with coefficients that are in concordance with the clinic intuition.

- Comparing performance and results to well-known baseline models.

- Clinical Sanity Checks (Do we have young patient with high predictions?)

]

.panel[.panel-name[Now 👴]
### A-parametrics Statistics might be extremly useful

- Statistics develops all the time, and it doesn't go anywhere. 

- Students from the Computer Science department make a lot more money because they know *how to code*. 

- It's relatively easy for a statistician to learn how to code.

- It's extremely difficult for a computer scientist to learn how to be a statistician.
